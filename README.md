What if you could travel through Wikipedia? Well, using this tool, you can!

 Starting from any Wikipedia page, you will travel only by clicking the links contained within a page to get to other pages.
 
 To begin your trip, enter the link of an initial Wikipedia article and the link of the article that you want to get to, as well as the number of stops you want to make in between (a good number is usually between 0 and 5 because no one likes a trip with a lot of layovers). Then, we will tell if you can get from the initial article to the destination article making at most the number of stops you selected!
 

## Description

I created this project as an entertainment project. A game I used to play was following the links of articles on a Wikipedia page to get to new pages and  following the links on that new page to see where I would end up. For example, It was interesting to notice that I could start with an article about a Brazilian Athlete and, just by following the linked Wikipedia articles on that page, I find myself on a page about a French movie. Hence, based on that experience, I decided to mimic it in code.
